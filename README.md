# React Hooks Handbook

## Description

**React Hooks Handbook** is a professionally curated collection of live, annotated examples showcasing both foundational and advanced React Hooks in a modern TypeScript environment, bootstrapped with Vite.
Tailored for developers aiming to deepen their expertise, this repository demonstrates real-world usage patterns, performance tuning techniques, and React’s concurrent features — all within clean, minimal components.

From mastering local state with useState and useReducer, to optimizing renders using useMemo and useCallback, and exploring cutting-edge concurrency with useTransition and useDeferredValue — every hook is presented in practical, contextual examples that accelerate both learning and implementation.

**All explanations are provided inline within the code as comments**, so you can see exactly how and why each hook works in context.
